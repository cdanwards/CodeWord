# Network Request Failures Resolution Plan

## Problem Analysis

The CodewordApp is experiencing network request failures in the iOS Simulator environment. The issues manifest as:

1. **"Network request failed" errors** in Supabase API calls
2. **Connection timeouts** when trying to reach external APIs
3. **iOS Simulator-specific** network connectivity problems
4. **Auth state working** but database operations failing

## Root Cause

iOS Simulator has known network connectivity issues with external APIs, particularly when:

- Running in development mode
- Using certain network configurations
- Accessing external services like Supabase

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Network Manager (`src/lib/network-utils.ts`)

**Purpose**: Detect network issues and provide fallbacks for iOS Simulator

**Features**:

- ‚úÖ iOS Simulator detection
- ‚úÖ Supabase connectivity testing
- ‚úÖ Network error classification
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback system
- ‚úÖ Timeout handling (5-second limit)

**Usage**:

```typescript
// Automatic fallback for database operations
const games = await withDatabaseFallback(
  () => db.getUserGames(userId),
  [], // fallback value
  "getUserGames",
)
```

### 2. Database Layer Updates (`src/lib/database.ts`)

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Wrapped `getUserGames` with network fallback
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to empty array when network fails
- ‚úÖ Preserved error handling for non-network errors

**Benefits**:

- App continues to work even with network issues
- Graceful degradation instead of crashes
- Clear logging for debugging

### 3. GamesScreen Updates (`src/screens/GamesScreen.tsx`)

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Integrated network manager
- ‚úÖ Added network status logging
- ‚úÖ Re-enabled database calls with fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive network testing

**Features**:

- Network tests run on screen load
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Fallback to empty state when network unavailable

### 4. Network Testing (`src/lib/network-test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive network diagnostics

**Tests**:

- ‚úÖ Basic network status check
- ‚úÖ Supabase connectivity test
- ‚úÖ Direct fetch to Supabase API
- ‚úÖ Auth session validation

## Testing Strategy

### 1. iOS Simulator Testing

- Run network tests on app startup
- Verify fallback behavior when network fails
- Check that UI remains functional

### 2. Physical Device Testing

- Test on real iOS device to confirm network works
- Verify Supabase connectivity on physical device
- Compare behavior between simulator and device

### 3. Web Testing

- Test in web browser environment
- Verify network connectivity in different environments

## Expected Behavior

### With Network Issues (iOS Simulator)

```
üì± iOS Simulator detected - network issues may occur
‚ùå Supabase connectivity check failed: Network request failed
üì± Using fallback for getUserGames (iOS Simulator network issue)
‚úÖ App continues to work with empty games list
```

### With Network Available (Physical Device)

```
‚úÖ Supabase connectivity: true
‚úÖ Direct fetch successful: 200 OK
‚úÖ Auth session check successful: true
‚úÖ Database operations work normally
```

## Fallback Strategy

### Database Operations

- **getUserGames**: Returns empty array `[]`
- **createGame**: Returns `null` (user sees error)
- **joinGame**: Returns `null` (user sees error)

### UI Behavior

- Games screen shows empty state
- Create/Join modals work but operations fail gracefully
- Clear error messages for user actions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)

1. ‚úÖ Implement network manager
2. ‚úÖ Update database layer with fallbacks
3. ‚úÖ Update GamesScreen with network testing
4. üîÑ Test on iOS Simulator
5. üîÑ Test on physical device

### Future Sessions

1. **Physical Device Testing**: Deploy to real iOS device
2. **Web Testing**: Test in browser environment
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Consider Expo Go vs development build
4. **Network Configuration**: Investigate iOS Simulator network settings

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/network-utils.ts`** - New network management system
2. **`src/lib/network-test.ts`** - Network diagnostics
3. **`src/lib/database.ts`** - Added fallback wrapper
4. **`src/screens/GamesScreen.tsx`** - Integrated network manager

## Success Criteria

- [ ] App doesn't crash on network failures
- [ ] UI remains functional with empty state
- [ ] Clear logging for debugging
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks for all database operations
- [ ] Network tests provide useful diagnostic information

## Notes

- This solution provides immediate relief for iOS Simulator development
- The app will work normally on physical devices with network
- All network issues are logged for debugging
- Fallbacks ensure the app remains functional during development
